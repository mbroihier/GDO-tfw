Given that the controller and user interface are up, pressing the open/close button when the door is closed, opens the door.  This simple test case confirms the external interfaces between the Android device and Raspberry PI 0 W controller, the interfaces between the controller and the relay, and between the relay and the garage door opener.  Without these properly connected interfaces, the door will not open.

By having the controller off after running the last two test cases, this test case will demonstrate that the user interface will display a communication failure message because the controller will not be accessible.
