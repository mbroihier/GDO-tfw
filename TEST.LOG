Log data:
Variation of the test - in this case, I tested with a controller not attached to an actual garage door.  This is not a full test because no door is physically changing state, but it is testing the boot response of the PI.  In this case I do a shutdown -r now and start a timer.  After 60 seconds I send the command - it should say Authentication Failed.  The next command should then succeed.

Trial 1: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 2: Communication Failed
Trail 3: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 4: Communication Failed
Trial 5: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 6: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 7: Communication Failed
Trail 8: Communication Failed
Trial 9: Communication Failed
Trial 10: Authentication Failed then Passed

50% of the time, 1 minute was not long enough to recover from a reboot.

Log data:
UI and controller both setup for UUID 00000003-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb.  The node of the controller is rpi3 and UI looks for rpi3 to set the "device" in the Key object.  Forgot rpi3 on the UI, turned on discovery and agent on the controller.  On the Android device I paired with rpi3 and then ran the GDO UI successfully.

Log data:
Server is advertising the service RFCOMM (UUID 00000003...).  Tried a variation of the procedure and found that I should really be turning pairable to off and I'm no longer certain I need agent.  Once paired, however, communication to the controller worked. Need to change these procedures to turn on/off pairable.
