Log data:
Variation of the test - in this case, I tested with a controller not attached to an actual garage door.  This is not a full test because no door is physically changing state, but it is testing the boot response of the PI.  In this case I do a shutdown -r now and start a timer.  After 60 seconds I send the command - it should say Authentication Failed.  The next command should then succeed.

Trial 1: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 2: Communication Failed
Trail 3: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 4: Communication Failed
Trial 5: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 6: Authentication Failed then Passed
Trial 7: Communication Failed
Trail 8: Communication Failed
Trial 9: Communication Failed
Trial 10: Authentication Failed then Passed

50% of the time, 1 minute was not long enough to recover from a reboot.
