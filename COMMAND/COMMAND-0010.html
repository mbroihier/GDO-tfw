<td id="objective"><p>This test case is intended to verify the following implied or specified requirements:</p>
<ul id="requirementsList">
<li>When the Android app is started a main page shall display as a minimum:</li><li>A text field that displays the status:</li><li>The app shall display a status of &quot;Command Successful&quot; when it receives a successful indication from the controller.</li><li>When the command button is pressed, the app shall:</li><li>Open a bluetooth connection to the controller.</li><li>Send an authentication message to the controller.</li><li>Wait for and accept a controller reply.</li><li>The reply shall be displayed in the status field of the main menu.</li><li>Close the bluetooth connection to the controller.</li><li>The bluetooth server shall:</li><li>Accept a single client connection.</li><li>Accept a single byte stream from the client limiting the stream to a fixed maximum number of bytes.</li><li>Apply an algorithm to assure the bytes are expected and have not been observed before.  This authenticates the client.</li><li>If the client authenticates, close the push button connection to the garage door for a fixed number of seconds.</li><li>Send a reply of Command Successful if authentication was successful and Authentication Failure otherwise.</li><li>Close the client connection.</li><li>The GDO user interface shall display a momentary status message after the button is pressed that shall display the status of the command attempt.</li><li>The GDO user interface shall display a successful message if it receives a successful reply from the Raspberry PI 0 W.</li><li>The GDO command processor (Raspberry PI 0 W) shall have one GPIO pin dedicated to actuating a switch connected to an Overhead Door model 456.  This pin will be directly connected to the relay command pin.</li><li>The GDO command processor (Raspberry PI 0 W) shall have one GPIO pin dedicated to supplying power to a switch connected to an Overhead Door model 456.  This pin will be directly connected to the relay power pin.</li><li>The GDO command processor (Raspberry PI 0 W) shall have a ground GPIO pin directly connected to the relay ground/common.</li><li>A relay channel associated with the actuating control of GDO-PROC-EXT-IF-010 shall have one terminal connected to the Overhead Door electrical connector identified as &quot;PUSHBUTTON&quot;.</li><li>A relay channel associated with the actuating control of GDO-PROC-EXT-IF-010 shall have another terminal connected to the Overhead Door electrical connector identified as &quot;COMMON&quot;.</li></ul>
<p>Given that the controller and user interface are up, pressing the open/close button when the door is closed, opens the door.  This simple test case confirms the external interfaces between the Android device and Raspberry PI 0 W controller, the interfaces between the controller and the relay, and between the relay and the garage door opener.  Without these properly connected interfaces, the door will not open.</p></td>
